### Users should be able to: 
1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
2. See all countries from the API on the homepage
3. Search for a country using an input field
4. Filter countries by region
5. Click on a country to see more detailed info on another page
6. Click through to the border countries on the country page
7. Toggle the colour scheme between light and dark mode
